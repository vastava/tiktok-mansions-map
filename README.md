## [Mapping TikTok Mansions: an interactive exploration of influencer culture](https://vastava.github.io/tiktok-mansions-map/story.html)

The "TikTok mansion" phenomenon has exploded over the past summer — popular creators on the app will move into a mansion together to create content with one another.

This map illustrates how many content houses have launched since mid-March, when many states and countries went into lockdown due to COVID-19 — it shows that several creators moved across state lines, and even across countries, to join a content mansion amid the pandemic.

This map was built in Mapbox GL JS, and data was scraped from [famousbirthdays.com](famousbirthdays.com).
